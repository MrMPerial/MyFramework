# MyFramework
A Simple Responsive Framework

The idea is to use a very simple set of classes to create responsive websites.

Container Definitions:

    Containers can be set by a full width structure by using "ful" or with a margin using "con".
    
Row Definitions:
    
    A row can be used to encapsule columns with "row" just like in Bootstrap.

Column Definitions:

    Mobile is set by using "m" followed by the desired width percentage such as 25 for 25%.
        m25 = a 25% width on screens smaller than 786 pixels.
        
    Tablet is set bu using "t" followed by the desired width percentage such as 33 for 33.3333%.
        t33 = a 33.3333% width on screens bigger than 768 pixels but smaller than 992 pixels.
        
    Desktop is set by using "d" followed by the desired width percentage such as 50 for 50%.
        d50 = a 50% width on screens bigger than 992 pixels.
        
Current settings are as follows:

    Mobile --
        m25 = 25%
        m33 = 33.3333%
        m50 = 50%
        m75 = 75%
        m100 = 100%
        
    Tablet --
        t25 = 25%
        t33 = 33.3333%
        t50 = 50%
        t75 = 75%
        t100 = 100%
        
    Desktop --
        d25 = 25%
        d33 = 33.3333%
        d50 = 50%
        d75 = 75%
        d100 = 100%
        
More to come...
